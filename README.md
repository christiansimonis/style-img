# Style Transfer


Quickly learn and transform the style of images by defining just four (sets of) parameters
* Content image
* Style image
* Content weight
* Style weight


The methodology is based on deep learning using convolution and pooling layers for a generative style transfer.

# Example
1. Input: content 

<img src="https://github.com/christiansimonis/style-img/blob/main/rome.jpg" height="40%" width="40%">

# +

2. Input: style 

<img src="https://github.com/christiansimonis/style-img/blob/main/sketch.jpg" height="40%" width="40%">

# = 

Output: stylized image

<img src="https://github.com/christiansimonis/style-img/blob/main/vis/stylized-image_sketch.png" height="40%" width="40%">
